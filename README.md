# EV-Charging-Project
Electric Vehicles Charging Project

Problem Description
▪ There are a group of EV users asking for charging at four type charging stations. Each charging
station has multiple identical charging points.
▪ Different type of charging stations are compatible with different type of Evs.
▪ Each charging point is able to charge one EV at one time.
▪ The charging request of EV user is characterized by needed travelling distance and feasible
charging time window. EV user wants to charge their EVs in order to travel for that prederminted
distance, thus, each charging station can estimate the needed charging duration for each EV
user.
▪ An EV user can not accept a charging time which is not in the feasible charging time window.
▪ The charging station aims at maximizing the number of charging EVs such that all the charging
constrains are satisfied.
